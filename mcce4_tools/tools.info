cif2pdb           :: convert cif to pdb

clear_mcce_folder :: Delete all MCCE outputs from a folder.
                     Kept: run.prm, original pdb and prot.pdb, as well as any non-MCCE files.

filesdiff         :: Obtain the column difference between two mcce files, or diff all files in
                      two mcce output folders. The difference file is saved with the 'diff_' prefix.
                      Applicable to these files:
                      all_pK.out, all_sum_crg.out, entropy.out, fort.38, head3.lst, pK.out,
                      residues_stats.txt, sum_crg.out, vdw0.lst.

get_aver_pqr      :: Obtain an occupancy-weighted charge pqr file using the occupancy table (fort.38)
                     and step2_out.pdb data.
                     Minimal usage: get_aver_pqr

getpdb            :: Download one or more (bioassembly) pdb files from the RSCB Protein Data Bank.

md_clustering     :: Given a topology file and one or more trajectories, save the pdbs of the
                     clusters elements in the topology file's parent directory.

md_extract_frames :: Extract a trajectory's frames with the given indices into pdb files with options
                     to select segment and cofactors, and print the structure segments parsed by
                     MDAnalysis.

md_fix_psf_mdanalysis :: Test the instantiation of a MDAnalysis.Universe given a PSF topology and
                         its associated DCD trajectory file.
                         Upon failure, a new psf file is created using `parmed`, which is then used
                         as the topology file in a new MDAnalysis.Universe instantiation attempt.
                         - If that attempt is successfull, the user is notified that the new psf file
                           is to be used;
                         - If not: the new psf file is deleted and the user is notified that the problem
                           could not be resolved.

                      Each pdb will have its own associated txt file containing their hbond donors,
                      acceptors, distances and angles. 

ms_hbnets3_nets    :: list_hbond_networks 

ms_hbnets4_stats   :: Analyze network similarites/statistics across a collection directory of microstate
                      associated network files.

ms_plot_energies.py  ::

ms_protonation    :: Obtain Protonation Microstates Analysis with Weighted Correlation
                     The requied input is a parameter file of which two examples can be found
                     in MCCE4-Tools/cli_parameters_files/: 'params.crgms' and 'minimal_no_bounds.crgms'.
                     Make a local copy to your working dir 'some_dir':
